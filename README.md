# Next.js Starter Template

This repository is a **Next.js 14** starter template utilizing **TypeScript**. It incorporates **Redux Toolkit** for state management, **Axios** for making API calls, and **React Query** for efficient data fetching. The project uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling and employs **ESLint** and **Prettier** for code quality. **Husky** and **lint-staged** streamline the development workflow.
